# About

This bot has been created for training purposes.

# Options

* `!sayHello ${Username}`

Create a wave for any member of your server.

### Example
    `!sayHello @useless bot`

## Let's get to the dirty stuff ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

As described in da description the bot removes the rude word(or racist) just anything you have no desire to be present in your server. <br> English ↗.

### How?
Using latest technology we can identify any word you add to the json file `wordList.json`.
All you have to do is adding the restricted words to the `restrictedWords` object, separated by `,` and surrounded with `""` or `''`. Just that when ever the word is present in your server the bot will send a small warning and then delete the message contains the restricted word.

## Get gay method

* `!howGay ${Username}`

Generates a *random* number with a meme for how gay is the mentioned user, **for fun**.

### Example
    `!howGay @useless bot`

## Singing

* It also can _sing_ with you for. Yes it's just that.

### Example

`Do u love me`

The bot replies: `Do u do u`

### Another example

`sAsAgEyO`

* You can write the word in any format even if you used _.sarcastice_ method with it, that's because we use the most modern regular expression technologies to process the text.

The bot replies: `Sasageyo! sasageyo! shinzou wo sasageyo! Subete no gisei wa ima kono toki no tame ni Sasageyo! sasageyo! shinzou wo sasageyo! Susumu beki mirai wo sono te de kirihirake`

This for you anime fans :D.
